## Daily Calculations

### Daily Average

$\overline{y\_\text{day}} = \frac{y_\text{max}+y_\text{min}}{2}$,

where $y_\text{max}, y_\text{min}$ are the maximum and minimum values, respectively, of variable $y$ recorded during a 24-hour day


### Record High Daily Average

Maximum $\overline{y_\text{day}}$ for the given day-of-year (DOY) over the course of the observational time series


### Record Low Daily Average

Minimum $\overline{y_\text{day}}$ for the given day-of-year (DOY) over the course of the observational time series


### Daily Average High

$\frac{\sum\limits_{n=1}^{d} y_\text{max}}{d}$



## Monthly Calculations

### Monthly Average

$\overline{y\_\text{mon}} = \frac{ \sum\limits_{n=1}^{d} \overline{y}_\text{day}}{d}$,

where $d =$ number of days in the month


### Record High Monthly Average

Maximum $\overline{y\_\text{mon}}$ for the given month over the course of the observational time series

### Record Low Monthly Average

Minimum $\overline{y\_\text{mon}}$ for the given month over the course of the observational time series
