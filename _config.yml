  This site contains climatologies (highs, lows, and averages) for atmospheric and oceanic variables derived from NOAA CO-OPS weather and tide observations.
  Current sites are updated daily; archived sites are updated less frequently.
  Data include air temperature, barometric pressure, wind speed, water temperature, and water level, though not all stations contain the same sensor suite.
